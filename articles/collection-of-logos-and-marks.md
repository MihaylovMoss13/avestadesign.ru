##BRANDING, LOGO DESIGN, ILLUSTRATION, & HAND LETTERING
>>A collection of logos and marks that I've designed over the last few years. Each one of these started off in a sketchbook, on a napkin, or on a post-it note, and miraculously made its way to my computer. This is where they are brought to life with vector magic. A great hand full of the work below was hand lettered and custom crafted to properly fit the aesthetic needs of the client.
