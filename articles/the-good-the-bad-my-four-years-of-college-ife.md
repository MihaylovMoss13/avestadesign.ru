I am gonna open my heart. OK. So let's begin.
The age 18, 19 and 20 ain't easy, you lose friends, you make mistakes, you fall, you fail, you realize things, you hit reality, you lose yourself, but in the end you find yourself and you become stronger and those are still the best years of your life too.

Once you enter a college, you are almost 18(an adult). There will be many 'small' instances that will have a 'big' impact on your life. You will meet a lot of people, out of them some will become your best friend for life, some you will hate no matter what, some will change your mood instantly just when you see them, it can bring happiness or even spoil your mood, some will become closer like really close. Even there will be people whom you never want to see and just wanna punch them in the face. I got three names for it. Let's not go in that way.

What you're about to read is a big part of my college days experience, lessons and it's not something I take lightly. I put a lot of thought into what I'd want 20-something-year-olds to learn from me and the things I gave up. It took a lot of efforts to connect all the dots. I pour my heart and soul in this story, opening the door for everyone to see what I see, to feel what I feel.

At this time you might be working in some cool office, some will be preparing for the next CAT, GATE, some will be going for civil services, govt. jobs, Some will be enjoying life as it is,  some will still be figuring out what they wanna do with their life, well this is a lifetime question, answer for it will change as time goes by. Whatever, now and then memories of those days hits you and you start to feel all that back again. Here is some of the thing I got to know that make me who I am today and in hope when you read all this, you feel somewhat connected.

### Make friends, a lot them
I cannot even imagine where I would be today were it not for that handful of friends who have given me a heart full of joy. Let's face it, friends make life a lot more fun. Isn't it obvious friends are the thing, they make everything worthwhile. When one comes to college, life is totally different from that we are used to. Schoolmates are far away. During my first year, I lived in a hostel, NBH room number 160. Coming from Varanasi to Lucknow and living here in the college hostel was a totally new experience. That year was a year that I came to meet a lot of people coming from all new different background. some got connected instantly and we became bros, some while knowing them as time pass by. during that year I made a lot of friends, many of them still connected to me and once a while sharing our stories. Hangout and do party. Living in a hostel has its own adventure. You meet people that come from totally different background, culture, it's like living in a world where you question 
Sala ye bhi hota hai, Aise bhi log hote hai, I met people that were brilliant at something, I met people that were amazing singers, artist, photographer, comedian. Things that came to them naturally. The people around us have so many wonderful characteristics worth admiring.
Perks of having a lot of friends is that you got a diverse kind of people and got to choose whom you want to spend time with according to your mood, time place etc. When you are down friends are there for you as they were for me always. A mere thanks are always less for all these people. Make a lot of friends. Some are for the time being some sticks and those who stick are there for life. They are gold. Gold is love.


In my view, the value of friendship cannot be measured by monetary metrics - the companionship, the support they offer are intangible in nature; their selfless love priceless. If it weren't for them, I wouldn't be the very person I am today. They've helped shape who I am with their personality, their odd traits, and their random peculiarities.
"Power and money are the fruits of life…
But family and friends are the roots of life…
We can manage without fruits, but we cannot stand without roots."
I have some decent friends whom i can lean on. They are love.
### Fall in Love
The most beautiful people you'll ever meet aren't always the ones who catch your eyes first. No, the most beautiful are the ones that can never be figured out. The one you could talk with for many hours and still have a million things to ask. The people who have mind so lovely and special, you can't help but fall in love with them.
Love is not always kind either. Sometimes love is harsh. Sometimes it's a brutally honest truth. Sometimes it's tough love. Sometimes you do things for someone and they just, " Don't care" but you do it because you love them. I'm not saying this is healthy, but this is what love is. No more on this, its a volatile topic for me. 
What I wanna convey is find your love and love with all your heart, be there for them even when you don't feel like it. Just that. Love makes you a caring person. You must be a caring person man. It transforms you in a way you never have expected. 
### Have people who care for you.
You already be knowing this, the people you surround yourself are the people responsible for your most of the growth, development, happiness, sadness, every emotion you feel. If you have people who care for you, consider yourself blessed. When coming to this, I consider myself very lucky. During those 4 years, I came to know many people, some from the heart, who were the people who always looked over me, guided me, scolded me, accepted me as I am and helped me, pushed me to come out of my comfort zone and to look beyond. If you are reading this, know this I am very thankful to you. A ton of thanks to TBT family and my classmates and to whoever's we felt a connection.
