      using Cricbuzz app and their pain-points.

      <br>
      <br>

      So instead I carefully observed each screen, realized what's missing and what can be
      done to make user experience more intuitive.

      <br>
      <br>

      One thing that really needed to be redesign was app navigation. If I have to go
      from one screen to another, it was really difficult to manage them with one handed
      with thumb only. I love Samsung one UI and based on that I decided to restructure
      every screen of cricbuzz app also.

            This project was very long, there was so many changes done one after one. So many iteration.
            Well after the development the website traffic increased. People started taking there seriously.
            The problem that was there before redesign was solved. The development team did a great job and
            took my design even further and better with all the tweaking done from time to time.
