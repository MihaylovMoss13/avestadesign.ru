      user research. But I did talk to some friends and asked their existing experience of
      using Cricbuzz app and their pain-points.

      <br>
      <br>

      So instead I carefully observed each screen, realized what's missing and what can be
      done to make user experience more intuitive.

      <br>
      <br>

      One thing that really needed to be redesign was app navigation. If I have to go
      from one screen to another, it was really difficult to manage them with one handed
      with thumb only. I love Samsung one UI and based on that I decided to restructure
      every screen of cricbuzz app also.
