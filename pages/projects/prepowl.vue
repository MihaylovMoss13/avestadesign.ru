      para=" It all started in 2017, Yash Srivastava and Zainab Siddique,
    my seniors, co-founded feeding trends. I was in 6th semester, enjoying some home time during summer vacation, got a call from
    Yash sir and I was asked to do a logo design for FeedingTrends. I remember it was a long call. Well moving forward, logo designing
    is tough, I took my time and did textual logo, used a  Sans font, outlined it, played around arrow, to make it feel like 
    trendy stuff and yeah Finished. We moved forward and setup  implemented logo on Facebook, Instagram and on stuff.
    FT got recognized and people started sharing our stuff and yeah it was great start.
    <br><br>
    Later on after 2 month I joined FeedingTrends. While still managing my time around
    college and working at feeding Trends Office. Bunking Classes just to work on outgoing projects at FT Office or from my flat.

            After layout and content strategy, It was time to set a
            theme and colour palette It was time to design a simple,
            clean and elegant showcase website. The accent colour I
            choose was Dark moderate cyan.. Later on while project was
            in design phase I chamged the theme from Cyan to Gradient feel,
            to make it more contrast and modern feel.
            I decided to use red as theme colour
