> I always wanted to have a personal website. Never new how to code. So I challenged myself #100DayOfCode. This Website and repository is my journey to learn how to code and along the way make an awesome personal porfolio website for showcasing all my Design Works.

>Feel free to Go through my code
>Made with [vue.js](https://vuejs.org) framework and [nuxtjs](https://nuxtjs.org).

>Have Fun. ðŸ˜„
